<p> Humans have used camels for their wool, milk, meat, leather, and even dung, which can be used for fuel. 
The dromedary camel, also known as the Arabian camel, exists today only as a domesticated animal. 
About 90 percent of the world's camels are dromedarie
Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!
When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.
Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day.
Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!

<p> Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015.
 These species come in a range of colors, and many species have the ability to change color.
Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their swaying gait;[2and crests or horns on their brow and snout.
 Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail. 
Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.

Chameleons are adapted for climbing and visual hunting. They live in warm habitats that range from rainforest to desert conditions, with various species occurring in Africa, Madagascar, southern Europe, and across southern Asia as far as Sri Lanka. They have been introduced to Hawaii, California, and Florida.
